## Trait Histograms

```{python}



# Define bin edges
bin_edges = np.arange(0, 12.5, 0.5)

# Create a histogram using plotly with custom bins
fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Histogram(
    x=df_wave_0[' Speed Trait'],
    xbins=dict(
        start=0,
        end=12,

# Update the layout for better readability
fig.update_layout(

    xaxis_title='Speed',
    yaxis_title='Number of Slimes',
    bargap=0.1,

# Save the plot as an HTML file
fig.write_html('speed_histogram.html')

# If you want to display the plot in a Jupyter notebook or in Quarto
fig.show()

1. **What is the correct name for this type of graph?**
    - A. Scatterplot
    - B. Histogram
    - C. Regression Line
    - D. Time Series

<details>
<summary>Click to see the answer</summary>

**Answer:** B. Histogram

**Explanation:** A **Histogram** is a special type of bar chart that shows the frequency distribution of another variable.
</details>


22. **What is your best estimate of the range of the data for Speed?**
    - A. 1.0 to 5.5
    - B. 1.0 to 5.0
    - C. 0.0 to 12.0
    - D. 0.0 to 109.0

<details>
<summary>Click to see the answer</summary>

**Answer:** A. 1.0 to 5.5

**Explanation:** Values of Speed are shown on the x axis, and the range is defined as the lowest and highest value of the variable.  The lowest value of Speed is in the 1.0 bin, and the highest value is in the 5.5 bin.
</details>

23. **What bin contains the Mode of the distribution for Speed?**
    - A. 1.0 to 1.5
    - B. 109 Slimes
    - C. 2.0 to 2.5
    - D. 6.0 to 6.5

<details>
<summary>Click to see the answer</summary>

**Answer:** C. 2.0 to 2.5

**Explanation:** The Mode of a distribution is its most frequently observed value.  In this case, the 2.0 to 2.5 bin contains the most slimes.
</details>


## Scatterplots

```{python}



# Create a scatterplot using plotly
fig = px.scatter(df_wave_0, 
                 x=' Speed Trait', 
                 y=' Tower Attraction Trait',
                 title='Scatterplot of Speed Trait vs Tower Attraction (Wave Number = 0)')

# Update the layout for better readability
fig.update_layout(
    xaxis_title='Speed Trait',
    yaxis_title='Tower Attraction Trait',
    xaxis=dict(range=[0, 6]),  # Adjusting based on the histogram range
)

# Save the plot as an HTML file
fig.write_html('speed_tower_scatterplot.html')

# Display the plot
fig.show()

# Print some information about the filtered dataset
print(f"Number of observations with Wave Number 0: {len(df_wave_0)}")
print(f"Correlation between Speed Trait and Tower Attraction Trait:")
print(df_wave_0[[' Speed Trait', ' Tower Attraction Trait']].corr())

```



26. **What type of relationship appears to exist between Speed Trait and Tower Attraction Trait?**
    - A. Strong positive correlation
    - B. Strong negative correlation
    - C. Weak positive correlation
